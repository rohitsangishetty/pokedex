Simple Pokedex web application built with HTML CSS and JS.
This project served as my introduction into web development, as it was my first experience with HTML CSS and JS.
I fetched the data from the original 151 Pokemon through PokeAPI. Click on their name to display the data for that Pokemon.
Originally, I planned to have a search bar feature, but I could not get it to function appropriately.
